Building documentation
======================

.. todo::

   Clean up. Check python 2 and 3. Check package versions.

To build the documentation you need ``python``, ``doxygen`` and the following
``python`` packages: ``sphinx``, ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` and ``breathe`` (can be
installed with ``pip install package_name``). Enable the sphinx output by
setting and ``HPX_WITH_DOCUMENTATION_SPHINX=ON`` during |cmake|_ configuration.

To build the documentation build the ``docs_sphinx`` target using your
build tool.


Style guide
===========

These are the conventions used for writing documentation:

* Top-level headings use over- and underlines with ``=``.
* Sub-headings use only underlines with characters in decreasing level of
  importance: ``=``, ``-`` and ``.``.
* Use sentence case in headings.
* Refer to common terminology using ``:term:`Component```.
* Indent content of directives (``.. directive::``) by three spaces.
* For C++ code samples at the end of paragraphs, use ``::`` and indent the code
  sample by 4 spaces.

  * For other languages (or if you don't want a colon at the end of the
    paragraph) use ``.. code-block:: language`` and indent by three spaces as
    with other directives.
* Use ``.. list-table::`` to wrap tables with a lot of text in cells.
* Link to terms in the terminology section. New terms are always welcome.
